1.Strict Equality Operator (===):
The strict equality operator behaves identically to the abstract equality operator, except no type conversion is performed.
To be considered equal using ===, the types must match exactly.
If two values are not of the same type, === will simply return false.

Example:
JavaScript

5 === 5; // true (both operands are numbers)
'hello' === 'world'; // false (both operands are strings)
5 === '5'; // false (number and string are different types)

2.Abstract Equality Operator (==):
The abstract equality operator compares for equality after performing necessary type conversions.
If the types are different, it attempts to coerce the values to make the comparison possible.
Example:

JavaScript

5 == 5; // true (both operands are numbers)
'hello' == 'world'; // false (both operands are strings)
5 == '5'; // true (coerces string to a number for comparison)

<.>Always prefer using === over == to avoid unexpected type conversions.
The strict equality operator ensures more predictable behavior.
Following Douglas Crockford’s advice from “JavaScript: The Good Parts,” never use the evil twins (== and !=).
Remember that for objects, == and === behave consistently with each other, except in special cases.
